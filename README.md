Portfolio Website
Over the next couple of weeks I am going to create a Portfolio website. The goal is to create a fully responsive website and then expand on it. I have added a KanBan board for things that I wish to complete. I will be starting the project with simple html css and js. Once I have a functional website frontend I am going to utilize/learn ASP.NET and add in a blog section in order to learn and understand how to implement user authentication (cookies/ouath), routing, activeRecord (or similar), and other techniques that I have learned using Spring(java).
