General Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project is to build a backend using Spring and have a react front end. Looking 
to host the frontend on Github and then maybe use Heroku or netlify to host the backend
for the blog that I would like to attach.

A large portion of the website is going to be simply a portfolio page, ideally 
showing off some skills that can be transferred over to getting a junior developer job.

Goals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*note* there currently isn't a hard deadline on the project itself but I would
like to have at least a MVP up and running before April 9th. 

- Have a static website with contact info, projects, skills, links


Blog
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for the Blog I want to treat it as my journey into getting a job as at least
a bare mininum of a software developer, as that is where all the experience begins.
